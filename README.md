## Summary

In this study we aimed to develop a scripted workflow to update geographical information system (GIS) regression mapping models that use land use and other predictors. 
GIS regression mapping was first introduced by Briggs et al. 1997 and is a technique commonly used to create predictive spatial models (and spatiotemporal models) of pollutant levels. It is also known as land use regression (LUR), however, the label LUR does not reflect the fact that non-land use predictors are often used such as chemical transport models or remote sensing data (e.g. satellite aerosol optical depth). These models add more information than just land use data to the model as predictor variables. 
Such GIS regression mapping models are used extensively in epidemiological studies of health impacts of air pollution exposure.
